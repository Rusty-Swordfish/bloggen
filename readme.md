1. Tags and Categories
Allow posts to have tags (e.g., tags: ["Rust", "Blogging"]) or categories (e.g., category: "Programming").

Generate filtered pages for each tag or category.

Example:

/tags/rust.html → List all posts tagged with "Rust".

/category/programming.html → List all posts in "Programming".

2. Pagination
If you have many posts, add pagination to the index page (e.g., show 10 posts per page).

Example:

/index.html → Shows posts 1–10.

/page/2.html → Shows posts 11–20.

Add links like Previous and Next for navigation.

3. RSS Feed Generation
Generate an RSS feed (feed.xml) for your blog so readers can subscribe.

Example output:

xml
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Your Blog</title>
    <link>https://yourblog.example</link>
    <description>A blog about Rust and coding</description>
    <item>
      <title>Hello World</title>
      <link>https://yourblog.example/hello-world.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>Welcome to my blog!</description>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
4. Search Functionality
Add a JSON file with post metadata (e.g., title, slug, and tags).

Example: search.json

json
[
  {
    "title": "Hello World",
    "slug": "hello-world",
    "tags": ["Rust", "Introduction"],
    "date": "2025-03-30"
  }
]
Use JavaScript on the client side to allow searching posts by title or tags.

5. Draft Support
Add a draft: true field to frontmatter.

Exclude posts marked as drafts from the generated index and output.

Useful for posts still under development.

6. Post Summaries on Index
Instead of displaying full post content on the index page, show a short summary (e.g., the first paragraph or a summary field from frontmatter).

Example:

text
---
title: Hello World
date: 2025-03-30
slug: hello-world
summary: My first post using a Rust-powered blog generator.
---
7. Post Navigation
Add links to the previous and next posts at the bottom of each post.

Example:

text
<a href="previous-post.html">Previous Post</a> | <a href="next-post.html">Next Post</a>
8. Archives by Date
Generate archive pages grouped by year and/or month.

Example:

/2025/03.html → Lists all posts from March 2025.

/2025.html → Lists all posts from 2025.

9. Customizable Layouts
Extend the templating system to enable overriding or customizing layouts for specific posts.

Example:

Add a layout field to frontmatter (e.g., layout: minimal) and load different templates based on this field.

10. Image/Asset Handling
Add support for including images in posts using a folder structure like assets/ or posts/images/.

Copy these assets into the dist/ folder during generation.

11. Post Metadata in Footer
Add metadata like word count, reading time, or last updated date.

Example:

text
Word count: 350 | Estimated reading time: 2 minutes
12. Multi-language Support
Add support for writing posts in multiple languages by adding a language field to frontmatter.

Example:

/en/hello-world.html

/fr/bonjour-monde.html

13. Static Error Pages
Generate custom static error pages (e.g., 404.html) for better handling when users visit invalid URLs.

14. Data Analytics Integration
Include a static script that allows adding analytics (e.g., Google Analytics or Plausible).

Example: Include the <script> tag in the template, configurable by frontmatter.

15. Enhanced Markdown Features
Extend the Markdown processor to support additional features:

Table of contents (auto-generated for each post).

Footnotes.

Syntax highlighting for code blocks (using libraries like syntect in Rust).

16. Build Options
Add configuration to allow generating blogs with specific flags (e.g., build drafts only, regenerate only new posts, etc.).

Example CLI options:

text
$ cargo run -- --drafts   # Include drafts
$ cargo run -- --tag rust # Only build posts with "Rust" tag
